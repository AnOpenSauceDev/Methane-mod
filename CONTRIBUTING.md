# Methane Contribution Guide
The guidelines are pretty simple, there are just a few things you should follow:

## Programmers

- make sure to comment on your code so it's readable.
- try not to rely _too_ heavily on the Fabric API.
- try to seperate your own code into different classes and/or packages for further clarity.
- Instead of flooding the users logs with debug messages via `System.out.println` or `MethaneLogger.info`, please use the methods in the `Debug` class in `util` instead.
- Speaking of which, the `Debug` utilities are quite powerful for adding your own developer-only features to the game, without having to introduce bugs to non-developer users.

## Everyone else

If you don't know how to code, you can still help out by reporting bugs or helping translate the mod to other languages!
