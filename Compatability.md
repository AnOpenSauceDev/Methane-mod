# Methane Compatability Sheet

Key: ✔ = works, ❌ = broken, ⚠ = incompatabilities/server only, 🔧 = workaround(s) implemented in code, 🚧 = currently
being tested

this is a complete list of tested mods, mainly those i come across while using Methane. Most mods tested on older versions should work fine on 2.1.
