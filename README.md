# Methane
A Fabric/Quilt performance mod.

### Mod compat
[available here.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/blob/master/Compatability.md)

### for other programmers
Contributions are welcome, but some messy parts of the code might not be the best if this is your first time modding. <br>
If you want to learn anything about modding, i would suggest looking the source code of [my other mods](https://github.com/stars/AnOpenSauceDev/lists/my-mods) instead. <br>

Enjoy Methane? **Leave a ‚≠ê** (it gives me dopamine)

# other important things
Methane depends on the following mods: 
- Fabric API 
- Cloth Config
- Mod Menu

I'm working on other projects most of the time, so don't expect me to finish things straight away. <br>
Non-Issues should be handled in [Discussions.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/discussions) <br>

If you **REALLY** want to get your hands on bleeding-edge builds (for whatever reason), github actions always has builds of the latest commits.
