# Methane
A Fabric/Quilt performance mod.

### Mod compat
[available here.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/blob/master/Compatability.md)

### for other programmers
Contributions are welcome, but some messy parts of the code might not be the best if this is your first time modding. <br>
If you want to learn anything about modding, i would suggest looking the source code of [my other mods](https://github.com/stars/AnOpenSauceDev/lists/my-mods) instead. <br>

Enjoy Methane? **Leave a ⭐** (it gives me dopamine)

# other important things

I'm working on other projects most of the time, so don't expect me to finish things straight away. <br>
Any questions you have should be handled in [Discussions.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/discussions) <br>

If you **REALLY** want to get your hands on bleeding-edge builds (for whatever reason), github actions always has builds of the latest commits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> please do not re-upload my mods to other platforms without my permission. The only places this mod is available and supported is on Modrinth and Github. <br>

> Methane is on curseforge to prevent impersonation, no support will be given.
