# Methane
A Fabric/Quilt performance mod.

### Mod compat
[available here.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/blob/master/Compatability.md)

### for other programmers
~~The code here is a pretty big mess of mixins (initally made in a couple days).~~ **the project is way less messy now than it originally was, but it's still a bit complicated for beginner programmers.** <br>
If you want to learn anything about modding (mainly on the HUD side), i would suggest looking the source code of [my other mods.](https://github.com/stars/AnOpenSauceDev/lists/my-mods) <br>
for those who want to _~~suffer~~_ try out new things, have a look at the unstable [methane-next](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/tree/methane-next)

Enjoy Methane? **Leave a ‚≠ê** (it gives me dopamine)

# other important things
Methane depends on the following mods: 
- Fabric API 
- Cloth Config
- Mod Menu

I'm working on other projects most of the time, so don't expect me to finish things straight away. <br>
Non-Issues should be handled in [Discussions.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/discussions) <br>

If you **REALLY** want to get your hands on bleeding-edge builds (for whatever reason), github actions probably has it.
