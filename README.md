Methane is no longer in development, and the rewrite diverges too much from the original intent to be published as Methane. Please remove this mod from your instances/modpacks, as bugfixes/support will no longer be given.

Why the name? It takes Minecraft (a carbon atom), and puts lots of optimizations that will probably break other mods (hydrogen), and releases it out into the air (where things will explode). This is why this mod has been rewritten almost 3 times already!
