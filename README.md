# Methane
A performance mod.

### Mod compat
[available here.](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/blob/master/Compatability.md)

### for other programmers
The code here is a pretty big mess of mixins (initally made in a couple days). If you want to learn anything about modding, i would suggest looking at [my other mods.](https://github.com/stars/AnOpenSauceDev/lists/my-mods) <br>
for those who want to _~~suffer~~_ try out new things, have a look at the unstable [methane-next](https://github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/Methane-mod/tree/methane-next)

Enjoy Methane? **Leave a ‚≠ê** (it gives me dopamine)
